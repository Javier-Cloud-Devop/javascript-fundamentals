# JavaScript Fundamentals

Foundational JavaScript exercises and small projects completed as part of structured learning.

This repository focuses on building core programming logic before moving into more advanced topics and real-world applications.

## Concepts Practiced

- Variables (`let`, `const`)
- Data types (`Number`, `String`, `Boolean`, `null`, `undefined`)
- `typeof` operator
- Arithmetic operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`)
- String manipulation and `.length`
- String methods (`toUpperCase()`, `startsWith()`)
- Template literals
- Built-in objects (`Math.random()`, `Math.floor()`)
- Assignment operators (`+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`)
- Increment / decrement (`++`, `--`)
- Conditional statements (`if`, `else if`, `else`)
- Comparison operators (`===`, `!==`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`)
- Truthy and falsy values
- Short-circuit evaluation (`||`)
- Ternary operator
- `switch` statements

## Practice Projects

### Kelvin Weather Converter
Converts temperatures from Kelvin to Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Newton using arithmetic operations and variable reassignment.

### Dog Years Calculator
Calculates dog years from human age using conditional logic and multi-step mathematical transformations.

### Race Day
Assigns race numbers and start times based on age and registration status using boolean logic and conditional statements.

### Magic Eight Ball
Random number generation combined with `switch` statements to simulate an 8-ball response system.
