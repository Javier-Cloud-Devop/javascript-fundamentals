# JavaScript Fundamentals

Foundational JavaScript exercises and small projects completed as part of structured learning.

This repository focuses on building core programming logic before moving into more advanced topics and real-world applications.

---

## Concepts Practiced

- Variables (`let`, `const`)
- Data types (`Number`, `String`, `Boolean`, `null`, `undefined`)
- `typeof` operator
- Arithmetic operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`)
- String manipulation and `.length`
- String methods (`toUpperCase()`, `startsWith()`)
- Template literals
- Built-in objects (`Math.random()`, `Math.floor()`)
- Assignment operators (`+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`)
- Increment / decrement (`++`, `--`)
- Conditional statements (`if`, `else if`, `else`)
- Comparison operators (`===`, `!==`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`)
- Truthy and falsy values
- Short-circuit evaluation (`||`)
- Ternary operator
- `switch` statements
- Functions (declaration, arrow functions, parameters, return values)
- Variable scope (global vs block scope)
- Array manipulation (`pop`, `push`, `shift`, `unshift`, `splice`)

## Practice Projects

### Basics

**Kelvin Weather Converter**  
Converts temperatures from Kelvin to Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Newton using arithmetic operations and variable reassignment.

**Dog Years Calculator**  
Calculates dog years from human age using conditional logic and multi-step mathematical transformations.

---

### Conditionals

**Race Day**  
Assigns race numbers and start times based on age and registration status using boolean logic and conditional statements.

**Magic Eight Ball**  
Random number generation combined with `switch` statements to simulate an 8-ball response system.

---

### Functions

**Rock Paper Scissors**  
Implements game logic using reusable functions, parameters, return values, and conditional comparisons.

**Sleep Debt Calculator**  
Uses multiple functions to calculate weekly sleep debt and compare actual versus ideal sleep hours.

---

### Scope

**Training Days**  
Refactored variable scope by moving `random` inside its function, declaring `days` once in function scope, and passing `name` as a parameter to prevent scoping errors and duplication.

---

### Arrays

**Secret Message**  
Transforms an array using pop, push, shift, unshift, and splice to dynamically modify data.

## Purpose

Develop a strong understanding of JavaScript fundamentals and logical thinking, forming a solid programming base to support future work in cloud engineering and DevOps.
